*What do I think a math puzzle is?*
To put it broadly, I think a math puzzle in CS is any type of problem that originates from some type of mathematical theory. This could be graphs, integers, or some really complex type of math only top mathematicians can understand. I think a math puzzle is loosely defined, as I think a large amount of puzzles can be described that way.

*A Puzzle I Like*
A puzzle I like is the Rubik's cube. It's likely a very generic answer, but it's the only puzzle I can *actually* solve. I find it interesting that you can use algorithms to solve them, and I've always been fascinated with how this website works:  [Rubik's Cube Solver](https://rubiks-cube-solver.com)
